# Quick start: Search Guard Bundle

If you just want to try out Search Guard real quick, or if you want to verify that Search Guard works with your specific environment, we recommend to use the Search Guard Bundle.  

The bundle is an Elasticsearch installation that comes pre-installed and pre-configured with Search Guard. Just download, unzip and run. All required TLS certificates and all enterprise modules are included and fully functional. 

We keep the Search Guard Bundle up-to-date with the latest Search Guard versions, and provide it for both ES 2.x and ES 5.x. You can download it here:
