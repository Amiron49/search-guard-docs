# Search Guard Main Concepts

Search Guard can be used to secure your Elasticsearch cluster by using a wide range of technologies. While this offers great flexibility, it also means that you should familiarize yourself with all the basic concepts behind Search Guard, so you can choose and configure it according to your needs.

However, there is a basic pattern of steps that Search Guard executes when deciding if a user is allowed to perform a specific action or not. Depending on the chosen technologies, some of the steps are optional. The basic flow is as follows

* A user wants to **interact** with an Elasticsearch cluster
 *  this means any kind of interaction, ranging from issuing simple queries to changing the cluster topology
* Search Guard retrieves the **credentials** of the user
 * This can be achieved by explicitely asking (challenging) the user to provide this information, or it can be extracted directly from the request. Credentials can be something like a username/password combination, but also something like a hostname.
* Search Guard **authenticates** the credentials against an authentication backend.
 * This step is optional if you use for example Kerberos, TLS client or proxy authentication.
* Search Guard **authorizes** the user by retrieving a list of roles for the user
 * Roles retrieved in this step are called **backend roles**, for they are retrieved from a backend system. This step is optional. 
* Search Guard **maps** the user and her backend roles to **internal Search Guard roles**
 * sometimes this mapping resembles the backend roles 1:1, but more often than not you want to define dedicated roles for your specific ES use case.
* Search Guard determines the **permissions** associated with the internal Search Guard role, and decides whether the action the user wants to perform is allowed or not
 * If your are using docuement- and field-level-security, you can also apply more fine grained permissions based on document types and individual fields  

## Credentials

In order to **identify** the user who wants to interact with the cluster, Search Guard first needs the users **credentials**. 

What the term credential means depends on the technology you use for user identification. For example, if you use HTTP basic auth, then the credentials are the username/password combination the user provides.

If you use TLS certificates for identifying clients, then the credentials are already included in the certificate.

An credential provider can either be **challenging** or **non-challenging**. A challenging provider actively asks the user for its credentials (e.g. HTTP basic auth). A non-challenging authenticator extracts the user credentials from some other source (e.g. TLS certificate) without the need for user interaction.

## Authentication (authc)

Search Guard then **authenticates** the credentials **against a backend authentication module**. This step is performed by a so called **Authenticator**. 

Authenticators can be very diverse regarding their principles and inner workings. For example, a file based authenticator might simply verify a user against a file containing usernames and (hashed) passwords. An LDAP authenticator on the other hand verifies the users credentials against an LDAP server.

In order for Search Guard to work, there always has to be at least one authenticator configured. If this is not the case, an implicit one will be created. This will authenticate the credentials against the internal user database and use HTTP Basic as the credentials provider.

You can define more than one authenticator if necessary, but in most cased you will have exactly one authenticator talking to one authentication backend.

### External authentication / SSO

Search Guard also supports external authentication / Single Sign On solutions. In most cases, these systems act as a proxy and/or store authentication information in special HTTP header fields. Search Guard provides an HTTP proxy authenticator, which can read and interpret these fields. In that case, Search Guard has to **trust the external authentication system** to work correctly. 

## Authorisation (authz)

After an authenticator has **verified** a user's **credentials**, an (optional) authorisation module can collect additional roles for the authenticated user from a configured backend. 

These roles are called **backend roles**.

## Users and roles

After the user is verified and roles have been fetched, Search Guard will **map** the **user and any backend roles** the user has to **Search Guard roles**. 

In some cases you want to map the backend roles 1:1 to Search Guard roles, but more often than not you want to have a dedicated users- and roles schema for your Elasticsearch installation.

The mapping between backend roles / users and Search Guard roles is an n:m mapping.

## Permissions

On a high level, each interaction with Elasticsearch means that a particular **user** wants to **execute** an **action** on an Elasticsearch **cluster** or **one ore more indices**. This closely resembles the internal model of Elasticsearch.

Permissions in Search Guard are based on exactly this model. A permission defines

* which role
* can perform which action
* against wich cluster or index

A definition of a permission that allows searching a particular index looks like:

* `indices:data/read/search*`

Permissions are defined per role can be applied on cluster- and index-level.

## Action groups

The action model of Elasticsearch, and thus the permission model of Search Guard, allows for very fine grained settings. This can lead to long lists of permission settings that you need to repeat for several roles.

You can use **action groups** in order to save you from repeating permission definitions. An action group is an **alias for a set of permissions**. Action groups can also be **nested**. 

If you define action groups, you can use the name of the action groups in the permission settings configuration.

For example, the following snippet shows two action groups, where the `SUGGEST` action group is referenced by the `SEARCH` action group:

```
SEARCH:
  - "indices:data/read/search*"
  - "indices:data/read/msearch*"
  - SUGGEST
SUGGEST:
  - "indices:data/read/suggest*"
```

## Document- and field-level-security

You can use document- and field-level security (DLS/FLS) to control access to documents and even individual fields.

For example, you can define that only members of the `HR department` group have access to documents of type `payroll`, and that the field `bonus` is only displayed to users in the group `HR department lead`.

DLS is defined by one or more queries. Only documents that match the queries are accessible by the corresponding role:

```
_dls_: '{"term" : {"_type" : "payroll"}}'
```

FLS is defined by specifying the fields that should be visible to the authenticated user:

```
 _fls_:
        - 'bonus'
```
